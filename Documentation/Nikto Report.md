## Analysis of Nikto Scan Findings
This document details the findings from the Nikto scan and provides recommendations for addressing identified issues.

### Key Findings
- **Outdated Web Server Software**: The server is running an outdated version, exposing known vulnerabilities.
  - **Recommendation**: Update to the latest web server version.
- **Unsecured HTTP Methods**: Methods like `OPTIONS` and `TRACE` are enabled, which can be exploited.
  - **Recommendation**: Disable unused HTTP methods and allow only `GET` and `POST` if possible.

### Suggested Fixes
1. Update the web server to the latest version.
2. Restrict HTTP methods to only those necessary for application functionality.
3. Perform regular security audits on the server configuration.
