# ZAP Report

## Summary of Findings from OWASP ZAP Scan
This document summarizes the vulnerabilities and issues identified by the OWASP ZAP scan.

### Vulnerabilities Identified
- **Missing Security Headers**: HTTP headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `X-XSS-Protection` were missing.
  - **Recommendation**: Add missing headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Outdated Libraries**: JavaScript libraries used in the application were outdated, potentially exposing vulnerabilities.
  - **Recommendation**: Update all JavaScript libraries to their latest stable versions.

### Remediation Steps
1. Configure security headers for the web application server.
2. Regularly update libraries and application dependencies to mitigate risks from known vulnerabilities.
3. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to control resource loading and reduce XSS risks.
